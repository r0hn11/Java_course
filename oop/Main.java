        * OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING :
            - Used to map code according to real world problems for easier understanding and neat code writing methods
            - In short, OOP is solving real world problems using objects.
            -- Implements DRY (do not repeat yourself) focuses code reusability.

        * OOPs Terminology :
        1) Abstraction : Hiding internal details.
        2) Encapsulation : Putting various components together. Sensitive data is kept hidden from a user.
        3) Inheritance : Act of deriving stuff from an existing parent.
        4) Polymorphism : One entity, different forms.


        * Class: A blueprint for creating objects.
                 A collection of different and related variables and methods.
        * Objects: An instantiation of a class.
                   Memory is not used until an object of a class is not initialized.
