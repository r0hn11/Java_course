Interpreted language vs Compiled language

- Interpreter translates one line at a time to machine code
- Compiler scans the complete program then translates

| Interpreter                         | Compiler                            |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| One statement at a time             | Entire program at a time            |
| Needed everytime                    | Once compiled, not needed           |
| Partial execution if error found    | No execution if error found         |
| Easy for programmers                | Usually not as easy as Interpreted  |

Q. Is Java Interpreted or Compiled?
A. Both.It is a hybrid language. A .java file is compiled using javac (compiler) to create class files (byte code).
   Then this byte code is used by java interpreter to produce output.

   .java file ---> class file ---> interpreter ---> output

   A java file is compiled using a virtual machine (JVM) thus making java 'platform independent'.
   {
    Python also works in similar way, virtual machine varies with python base implementation language.
    e.g. cpython -> c implementation
         jython -> java implementation etc.
    }

Q. Executing java code manually
A. 1) Write code in a .java file.
   2) Compile it using command: javac Base.java
      A class file with the same name will generated for execution. This .class file is your byte code for interpreter
   3) Execute this .class file using command: java Base
      Output will be shown.
      If a package is mentioned then interpreter will fond a Main.class file for execution and will shoot error if not found. Otherwise any mentioned file will be executed.
